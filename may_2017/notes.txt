TODO:

 - Use index to draw actual selected card (stored in variable)

 - Create "deck" of cards (unshuffled) and turns into two hands of cards
 - Button shows next card until end of game
 
 - End of game show message

 - Score each comparison (no war)

 - Support war (ties)

 - have launch screen (decks as is, WAR at bottom of screen)

 - Fine positioning for card suites. Can we use positioning to draw sprites twice per line?
 - Fix color on sprites
