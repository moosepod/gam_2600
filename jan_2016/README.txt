January concept: "Friendship"

Game concept: "Friend Maze"

Fair warning -- this game idea was picked entirely based off what seemed doable with my current 2600 homebrew knowledge.

Basic design:
- Player navigates their toon through a series of increasingly difficult mazes
- End of maze has the "friend" you have to touch (animation?) to win the maze
- Each maze is timed. 
- Scoreboard shows current time and maze #
- If you run out of time you start back at the beginning of the current maze
