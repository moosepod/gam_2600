- Had a subroutine written that took in both a player position and a pointer to sprite data, but this ended up taking too many clock cycles to draw the wall and the player, so refactored it into dedicated drawing subroutines. I guess I could skip the jsr/rts if i really needed the cycles.
- Tried doing async playfields -- problem is then you have to swap the playfield on _both_ scan lines of the kernel, or you're going to be drawing the second half of the playfield on the first half of line two. THis removes any additional cycles you get by usign a two line kernel.

- Trying to fiddle with horizontal position of wall 
- Experimented  with just single X set for wall.

- I think i can get the X for the walls on scan line 1 if i add an offset adjustment. 	
- Too many cycles elapsed.
- Ahaha -- what if we used all the spare vsync cycles to calculate the various X offsets for the walls? But then we still have to find the coarse position...
- Do i have time to change one of the pfs and then back again? Time it out with some nops.
- Success!
- What causes the weird anonmaly across the X axis?
- I changed the ordering and it changed the anomaly to a "warp".
