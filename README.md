This is a repo for the One Game a Month project (http://www.onegameamonth.com/)

Everything in here is just m messing about and experimenting. Please do not assume any degree of completion or quality.

For the Atari 2600 games, using DASM pulled from https://github.com/munsie/dasm. I used the repo because the header files for the 2600 were included.

Random 2600 game ideas
- Basic war
 - Two 52 card decks
 - Shuffled
 - Play versus computer or not
 - Score

- CCG
 - Pick a (premade) deck
 - Get a subdeck drawn every game
 - Play against computer (AI will suck)

---------

Concept -- rebuild MooseWAR (after defining core gameplay) in a number of systems

- 2600
- NES
- PICO 8
- Pygame
- iphone (swift)
- macos 
- windows

- Rust?
- C/C++?
