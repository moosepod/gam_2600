This is a repo for the One Game a Month project (http://www.onegameamonth.com/)

Everything in here is just m messing about and experimenting. Please do not assume any degree of completion or quality.

For the Atari 2600 games, using DASM pulled from https://github.com/munsie/dasm. I used the repo because the header files for the 2600 were included.

Random 2600 game ideas
- Basic war
 - Two 52 card decks
 - Shuffled
 - Play versus computer or not
 - Score

- CCG
 - Pick a (premade) deck
 - Get a subdeck drawn every game
 - Play against computer (AI will suck)

---------

Concept -- rebuild MooseWAR (after defining core gameplay) in a number of systems

- Why war? it's a simple game conceptually. Some drawing, some animation, some sound.

- Moosewar is an implementation of the card game war
 - Has a start state, a game state, and two end-game states (with either player win)
 - Play against the computer (does it really matter? can we support 2 player?)
 - Each player starts with a score of 26. Win when one player hits 52.
 - Push button (or appropriate action) to draw next card
 - Highest card gets cards. cards
 - Game ends when no more deck
 - If tie, draw _three_ cards 
 - Ace is high
 - Cards go to bottom of deck.
 - Players are Player (left) and computer (right)
 - Play theme song on start page
 - Play sounds on card deal (maybe a beep beep beep for war?)
 - Card draw/shuffle animations?
